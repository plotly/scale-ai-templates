# Scale AI Apps

To run the apps locally, please see [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## 1. Product Reviews Modeling with Snowflake

This template app performs sentiment analysis and topic extraction on hundreds of thousands of product reviews stored in Snowflake. Business end users can use this app to create a focused search of product reviews, for example, to identify recent negative reviews and the specific entities (e.g. brands, products) that most frequently appear in them. Demand projections informed by the sentiment analysis can reduce buy-to-stock models in favour of a buy-to-order model.

Setup instructions [here](apps/snowflake-product/README.md).

## 2. Steel Defect Segmentation

This template app allows end users to automatically segment defective surfaces from pictures of steel sheets. The heatmap view enables quality inspectors to quickly locate larger areas, and makes it easier to identify small defects that might have otherwise been missed. By incorporating open-source Dash Button and Download components, end users may save segmented images locally or to a database for supplier performance reporting.

The `steel_images` directory was retrieved from the validation split of the [NEU surface defect database](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yunhyan/NEU_surface_defect_database.html).

## 33. Dash Cytoscape: Leaflet, Context Menu, & Voltage Network Algorithim 

This Dash application contains **2 brand new features** for the [Dash Cytoscape](https://dash.plotly.com/cytoscape) library
and **an algorithim** that predicts the connections between various components (poles, transformers, and residential users) in an voltage network.

Features:

1. Leaflet map integration for the [Dash Cytoscape](https://dash.plotly.com/cytoscape) library
2. Context menu for the [Dash Cytoscape](https://dash.plotly.com/cytoscape) library (try right clicking on the graph)
3. An algorithim that takes in voltage network data and predicts the connections between the various components (poles, transformers, and residential users).


This template demonstrates **2 brand new features** for the [Dash Cytoscape](https://github.com/plotly/dash-cytoscape) library and **an algorithim** that predicts the connections between various components (poles, transformers, and residential users) in an voltage network.

The Leaflet map integration feature allows users to overlay a Cytoscape graph on top of any [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) supported map, by leveraging the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library. This gives users the ability to visualize and interact with network graphs on a map. 

The context menu feature allows users to right click on a Cytoscape graph and select a menu item, where the logic for the menu item is determined via Dash callback. This means that for all menu items, the business logic is completely determined by the Python developer. Some example use cases could be: adding nodes, removing edges, collapsing nodes, and renaming nodes. 

Using the included algorithim, users can take in voltage network data consisting of soley node locations and predict the connections between the nodes.

When combining the two features, the users have a powerful way to create, manipulate, and visualize network graphs overlaid on a map. The prediction algorithim provides an interesting example of the art of the possible for users, where users can visualize and understand how to create a network algorithim that works with Dash Cytoscape. For users in the power engineering space, the voltage algorithim may prove useful as an algorithim that they can use and iterate off to improve/create power distribution grids.

These features were created in collaboration with [Zyphr Solutions](https://www.zyphr.ca/).
